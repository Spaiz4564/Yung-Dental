            Michael Young completed a program in dental technology at a
            Philadelphia vocational school and started Young Dental Laboratory
            in the spare room of his home in 1980. Michael’s exceptional manual
            dexterity allowed him to excel in orthodontics and open Young
            Orthodontic Laboratory. In partnership with his wife, Angeline,
            assisting with many tasks, the business grew into other specialties
            like removables. Michael supplemented his skills by attending
            continuing education courses and workshops. The laboratory
            ultimately moved to a larger space shortly afterwards and later was
            able to purchase a neighboring building where they spent the next
            decade.

            Their eldest son, Joe, joined the business in 1999 after earning his
            bachelor’s degree in Business Administration. With Joe as the
            full-time business administrator, the lab was able to focus on
            customers and other business functions while his parents focused on
            production; five years later they moved to another larger location.
            Their current facility has expanded to include fixed restorative
            services including conventional crown and bridge, implants, full
            arch rehabilitation, and an array of digital offerings. In 2005,
            they obtained Certified Dental Laboratory (CDL) status from the
            National Association of Dental Laboratories, a credential
            recognizing strict infection control, case management, an assurance
            that it has met specific standards of quality control, safety and
            manufacturing practices.

            Their youngest son, Steve, joined the family business in 2011 after
            earning a degree in Information Technology, a perfect fit to the
            industry’s growing technological advancements. The digital arsenal
            today includes scanning technology, design software, milling
            machines and 3D-printers. As clinical intraoral scanning becomes
            more popular, they are prepared to accept the growing capabilities
            of these new technologies and functions.

            Young Dental Laboratory’s success is due to the tremendous efforts
            of its professional team of technicians and staff. They value
            ongoing education to meet current trends and are prepared to meet
            the growing demands of clinical and patient expectations utilizing
            the latest restorative materials, equipment, and technology. They
            look forward to maintaining growth in digital offerings while
            seeking avenues that build value through continuing education for
            clinicians and technicians alike.
