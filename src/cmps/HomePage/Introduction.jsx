              quickly and efficiently. We know how stressful running a dental
              practice gets so we are committed to improved clinical
              experiences. Your day is stressful enough, your relationship with
              a laboratory shouldn’t be. Here, you’re like family.
            </p>

              We are members of the NADL, ACP, ITI and the only Certified Dental
              Laboratory (CDL) in the immediate tri-state region ensuring

              With any dental prosthesis, oral appliance or device, we believe
              every patient deserves to be treated using only the best materials
              fabricated on the most up-to-date equipment and technology.
              Whether hand-crafted from quality traditional materials or
              digitally design and manufactured, rest assured that all materials
              are FDA and ADA approved and/or assured.
